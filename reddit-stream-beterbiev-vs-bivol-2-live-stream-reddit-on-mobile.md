Beterbiev vs. Bivol 2 is in Saudi Arabia on February 23. The event airs around 4:30 a.m. NZDT. The main event fighters should make their way to the ring around 12 p.m. local time, depending on how long the undercard fights last.

Beterbiev (21-0) has held light heavyweight gold since 2017. The Russian with Canadian citizenship had a 100% knockout-to-win ratio before the first Bivol fight. He had to dig deep in the later rounds to win via majority decision after Bivol started hot.

The four-time amateur gold medalist admitted he wasn't 100% in the first fight. Beterbiev believes he has what it takes to finish Bivol heading into the rematch.

"If you compare [my other fights], you can say it was my toughest fight," Beterbiev said via DAZN. "But it is a little bit different. I think in my boxing career, I've [fought] stronger guys. But you can say it was my toughest fight. Of course [I could have done better].

"The knee was a problem in the first fight, but it is near perfect now. My movement should be much better for this fight. My performance in the first fight was not perfect, I know I can do much better in this one."

The loss ended Bivol's (23-1) firm grip at light heavyweight since winning interim gold in 2016. The Russian has beaten a who's who at light heavyweight and has even taken down those who have moved to the weight, like Canelo Alvarez and Gilberto Ramirez.

Though he landed the more accurate punches in October, Bivol lost the fight. He hopes the outcome will be different following a different game plan this time.

"I hope I can give a better performance than I did before, and I believe I can be the winner of this fight," Bivol told The Stomping Ground via DAZN. "To become undisputed would mean I've done well. It's the final step in this weight class, and the proof for myself. I'm happy that I have this chance.

"I didn't like [how I performed that night]. There was some doubt inside of my head. I want to win without doubt."
